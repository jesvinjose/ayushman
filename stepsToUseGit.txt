create backend and frontend folder structure
remove .git folder from frontend since it uses react
create .gitignore file in root folder and remove .gitignore from backend and frontend folders
then run npm init -y in the root folder
then run npm install concurrently --save-dev in the root folder
configure scripts in the root package.json for running backend and frontend parallely. 
this will allow us to run npm start from root folder 
initialize git in the root folder(ayushman), run command: git init
create remote repository in github
after creating the remote repository, link it to your local Git repository by running: git remote add origin https://github.com/jesvinjose/ayushman.git
run the command: git add .
make the first commit to main: git commit -m "Initial commit"
create main branch: git branch -M main
push to the main branch: git push -u origin main

Now to update using different branches follow the below summary:

# Step 1: Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-branch-name

# Step 2: Work on your changes and then stage and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Description of what you've done"

# Step 3: Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Step 4: Pull the latest changes from the main branch
git pull origin main

# Step 5: Merge your changes from the feature branch
git merge feature-branch-name

# Step 6: Push your changes to the remote repository
git push origin main
